# SimpleGamesLibrary
A program that lets you pick from and play a bunch of fun, simple games

This repository will contain a variety of games I have programmed, as well as a file which contains a tool to select which
game to run.

##gameRunner.py
This is the central file that is used to run all other files in this repository, and is the only one that automatically executes
code.

##FizzBuzz
This is a version of the game FizzBuzz. It informs the user when it is their turn, and gives the computer an 80% chance of replying
correctly.
